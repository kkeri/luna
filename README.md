# Luna Color Theme 

Luna is a dark color theme I created for my late night coding sessions.
You might like it as well.

My concept is using soft but distinctive colors for different parts of code.
Background is darker than most other themes with a warm tint.
I chose an outstanding color for constants as they worth extra attention.

Have a nice time!
