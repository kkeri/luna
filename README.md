# Luna Color Theme 

Luna is a dark color theme I created for my late night coding sessions.
You might like it as well.

My concept was using dimmed but distinctive colors for different parts of code.
The background is darker than most other themes with a warm tint.
An outstanding color is picked for constants as they worth extra attention.

The theme is currently in beta. 
File an [issue](https://github.com/kkeri/luna/issues) and let me know how can I improve it.
