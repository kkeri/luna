# Luna Color Theme 

Luna is a dark color theme I created for my late night coding sessions. You might like it too.

The theme is customized for Javascript, Typescript, JSON, HTML, XML, Markdown, makefiles and shell scripts,
however it should work well with any language.

Luna is currently in beta. File an [issue](https://github.com/kkeri/luna/issues) and let me know how can I improve it.
